PROFILE

As a research assistant | always try to define new boundaries and work in a
meticulous way to figure out solutions. | have used Machine Learning as a base
for our product design to synthesis chemical architectures and their reaction,
right now | would like to be involved more on the application development side
and was looking for an opportunity that did such.

EXPERIENCE

SK JADODIA LABS

CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS RESEARCH ASISTANT, JAN 2019 - ONGOING
Developed a Machine learning prediction model to optimize steam
consumption in MSFE.

Using Clustering determined paint molecules that affected
breathing issues in children.

Using Algorithmic synthesis decided which compounds should be
added to an industrial solution to result in a required reaction
without producing toxic waste.
