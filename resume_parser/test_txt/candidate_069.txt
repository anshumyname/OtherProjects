RACHEL DAWN

DATA SCIENTIST

WORK BACKGROUND

Innoplexus
Data Scientist Nov 2019 to Till Date

Build an end-to-end, Computer Vision and NLP-based PDF-Extractor
model to convert unstructured congress research paper pdf documents
into a structured and categorical format with a micro-average F l-score
of 0.84.

Created a model for identification and conversion of the graphical
representations of chemical structures from literature sources into
SMILES. Used OpenCV for various image preprocessing and OSRA an
open-sourced tool for SMILES generation.
